## Cricket Match Animation Module

This project includes a module to play an animated replay of simulated cricket match highlights.

### Features
- **Web-Based Animation**: Runs in the browser using Pygame (via Pyodide).
- **Dynamic Log Processing**: Takes a ball-by-ball log (generated by the main application or input manually in standalone mode) to drive the animation.
- **Visual Elements**:
  - Umpire's perspective view of the pitch.
  - Bowler run-up and bowling action.
  - Parabolic ball trajectory with bounce.
  - Batsman shots based on log outcomes (0, 1-6, Wicket). Stumps break on "bowled".
  - Basic fielder movement for scoring shots.
  - Crowd reactions (waving) based on events.
  - On-screen scoreboard displaying score, wickets, overs, and last ball.

### How to Run the Animation
1.  **Start the Flask Application**:
    Run the main Flask app: `python IPL-3.0/app.py`
2.  **Access in Browser**:
    Open your web browser and go to the application's homepage (usually `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`).
3.  **Select Teams**:
    On the homepage, select two different teams.
4.  **Launch Animation**:
    Click the "Animated Match Replay" button. This will:
    - Trigger a match simulation in the background using `mainconnect.py`.
    - Process the match log into a simplified format.
    - Load a new page (`animation_player.html`) which uses Pyodide to run the Pygame animation (`cricket_animation.py`) with the generated log.
5.  **Pyodide Loading**:
    The first time you load the animation page, Pyodide and Pygame need to be downloaded and initialized by your browser, which might take some time. Subsequent loads should be faster.

### Standalone Testing (for `cricket_animation.py`)
The `IPL-3.0/static/animation/cricket_animation.py` script can also be run as a standalone Pygame application (requires Python and Pygame installed locally):
```bash
python IPL-3.0/static/animation/cricket_animation.py
```
In this mode, it will present its own UI for team selection and log input/simulation.

### Files
-   `IPL-3.0/app.py`: Contains Flask routes, including `/setup_animation` for preparing data for the animation.
-   `IPL-3.0/mainconnect.py`: Simulates match logic and generates detailed logs.
-   `IPL-3.0/static/animation/cricket_animation.py`: The main Pygame script for the animation.
-   `IPL-3.0/templates/animation_player.html`: HTML page that hosts the Pyodide environment to run the animation.
-   `IPL-3.0/static/animation/sample_log.txt`: A sample simplified log file.
